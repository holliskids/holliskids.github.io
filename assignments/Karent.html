	<h2>About Me</h2> 
	
	<p>I am currently a junior at Northridge High school, I will be graduating in the class 2022. I am currently a part of the AVID program to help me be more on track with my school and it gives you a helping hand to look at colleges. The definition is really in the meaning of avid is, advancement via individual determination. I am trying to go to school for nursing. I am thinking about going into the nursing classes at Aims then later transferring to UNC and graduating. I have a bunch of interests everywhere. I also really like dropped trucks and jdm cars. I also have a large interest in makeup.</p>

<h2>Individual Choice</h2>
	<h3>Quote-</h3>
	
	<ul>
  <h4>'Life’s simple. You make choices and you don’t look back.’ -Han Lue
  </h4>
  <li>I can relate to this so much thats why i choose this quote to relate to. For me in life i dont focus on my mistakes or what i could have done better at one point. I just try to focus on the future and watch on how i react to things. Life isn't about choosing choices between what can help you its about what can help the things around you. Yes its alright to be selfish sometimes but sometimes it's just better this way.</li>
