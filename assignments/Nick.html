<h2>My Favorite Quote</h2>
	
	<blockquote>
	My favorite quote is said by GK Chesterton , “Fairy tales do not tell children that dragons exist, children already know that dragons exist. Fairy tales tell children that dragons can be killed” I like this quote because the mind fascinates me and the way different people look at situations gives them a sense of depth and an understanding of how other people think.
