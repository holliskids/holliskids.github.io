	<h2>About me</h2> 
	
	<p>My name is Alyssa Maj and I go to Northridge High School. I have gone to Northridge since my freshman year, I have been in the jrotc program and the cheerleading team ever since freshman year. My Junior year at Northridge I was in a little group called Link Leaders and what link leaders is that they help the incoming freshman and show them around the school and just be there for them. Northridge has been truly amazing, I will miss being around school because I made friends with the IFL kids. The staff are pretty amazing too, they are all caring and sweet, they can also be funny and fun but also strict. </p>

<h2>Individual Choice</h2>
	<h3>This picture is my favorite because it's a picture of my two Veteran grandpas that one is in the Marines and the other one is in the Air Force and they tease each other and it's fun and funny hanging out with them and having them around.</h3>
