	<h2>About me g</h2> 
	
	<p>I'm Esmeralda I go to the Northridge High School what I have learned in this year has been very complicated for me, I have only been here a year and it has become very difficult for me to understand English but despite that I put all my effort and I want to understand and be able to learn it very soon what I like the teacher Hollis is that she explains the work very well and although she is very funny and cute, I also like to share with my classmates.
