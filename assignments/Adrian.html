	<h2>About me</h2> 
	
	<p>Im a senior at Northridge High School who will be graduating in May 2021. I am in website design because it was one of the only few electives that seemed interesting. I have been working at Panera for 4 months, donâ€™t get hired there if you value your social life. Outside of school I mostly like to relax with video games or youtube.</p>

	<h3>A Poem about the Fear of Failure</h3>
	
	<blockquote>
	
		A fleeting world so little time<br />
		Now is my time to prove my worth<br />
		For if I don't its presence will surely hurt<br />
		In a way, in another world, I know my worth<br /><br />
	
		Not bound by the lies of the big guy<br />
		But for now i'll stick it through<br />
		Just so I can show you<br />
		You are you<br /><br />
