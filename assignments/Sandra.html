	<h2>About me</h2> 
	
	<p>Hey there! My name is Sandra and I am a senior at Northridge Highschool. I will graduate this year and attend a four year university right after. I have an interest in the engineering field and am hoping to pursue a career in this field. Therefore, when I heard of website design I took advantage of the opportunity of trying something new.</p>

	<h3>Fun Fact</h3>
	
	<blockquote>
	<p>
    
    </p>My interest in engineering began when I was younger. In middle school I took a robotics class in which I built, programmed, and completed missions. I was also involved in my own robotics team and was able to compete in the First Lego League Competition. Throughout my involvement in this I was able to grow a strong passion for engineering. On the day of this competition my team members left me alone to compete and I won a trophy at the end of the competition. This day was the day I made a few discoveries myself.
<ul> 
		<li>Indepence allows growth</li>
		<li>Courage is a risk to take</li>
		<li>The possibility of winning is higher than you think</li>
	</ul>
